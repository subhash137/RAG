Hit the ground running using third-party integrations and Templates.Productionization: Use LangSmith to inspect, monitor and evaluate your chains, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with confidence.Deployment: Turn any chain into an API with LangServe.Concretely, the framework consists of the following open-source libraries:langchain-core: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language.langchain-community: Third party integrations.Partner packages (e.g. langchain-openai, langchain-anthropic, etc.): Some integrations have been further split into their own lightweight packages that only depend on langchain-core.langchain: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.langgraph: Build robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph.langserve: Deploy LangChain chains as REST APIs.The broader ecosystem includes:LangSmith: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor LLM applications and seamlessly integrates with LangChain.Get startedâ€‹We recommend following our Quickstart guide to familiarize yourself with the framework by building your first LangChain application.See here for instructions on how to install LangChain, set up your environment, and start building.noteThese docs focus on the Python LangChain library.
